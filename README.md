**Serial Keno**

In Serial Keno you bet for how many consecutive numbers appear on the board after 20 numbers get selected randomly and without replacement from a total of 80 numbers.

The game pays according to the longest sequence to show up. For example, if the longest run is is a string of numbers from 2 to 10, the longest run is 9 and you get paid if the pay table has a corresponding payment. 

In addition, number 80 is linked to number 1. So numbers from 78 to 80 and from 1 to 5 make up a serie of 8 consecutive numbers.
